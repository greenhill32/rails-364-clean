PROGRESS LOG - February 14, 2026

================================================================================
WHAT WE DID TODAY
================================================================================

1. Added routing for pick-golden-day.tsx screen
   - File already existed: app/pick-golden-day.tsx
   - Confirmed Expo Router file-based routing auto-generates route from filename
   - No additional routing config needed; route `/pick-golden-day` works automatically

2. Fixed about.tsx screen flow
   - Added auto-progression: navigates to `/pick-golden-day` after 3 seconds
   - Kept "Begin" button so users can skip ahead manually
   - Pattern: useEffect with setTimeout → router.replace()

3. Created CLAUDE.md project documentation
   - Comprehensive guide for future Claude Code instances
   - Covers: development commands, routing architecture, directory structure
   - Documents: tech stack, common patterns, styling conventions, path aliases
   - Includes current screen navigation flow and onboarding pattern


================================================================================
WHAT WENT RIGHT
================================================================================

✓ Expo Router file-based routing eliminated need for manual route registration
  - File structure automatically becomes API surface
  - Clean, intuitive system for adding new screens

✓ Quick fix for about.tsx using proven pattern
  - Reused auto-progression pattern from index.tsx
  - Both button and auto-navigation provide good UX options

✓ CLAUDE.md creation captured project knowledge efficiently
  - File-based routing, screen flow, styling conventions now documented
  - Tech stack details preserved for next session
  - Path aliases, build config, common patterns all noted

✓ Project uses TypeScript with strict mode - type safety enabled


================================================================================
WHAT WENT WRONG
================================================================================

✗ Initial confusion about routing setup
  - I didn't immediately recognize Expo Router handles routes via file structure
  - Expected manual route config when none was needed
  - Required clarification from user

✗ Incomplete understanding of app flow on first pass
  - Didn't check about.tsx until asked to fix the "second screen stops" issue
  - Should have mapped full screen navigation flow earlier


================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. Expo Router is file-based by default
   - Files in app/ directory automatically become routes
   - Filename → URL path (pick-golden-day.tsx → /pick-golden-day)
   - No manual routing setup needed; conventions over configuration

2. Ask clarifying questions upfront
   - "Either add button or auto progress" was ambiguous
   - Could have asked user preference before implementing
   - Instead, added auto-progress which complemented existing button

3. Map screen flows early when working with navigation
   - Index → About → PickGoldenDay → Calendar (not yet created)
   - Understanding the full flow prevents duplicate work

4. Auto-progression pattern is useful for onboarding
   - User can wait or click to skip
   - Pattern: useEffect + setTimeout + router.replace()
   - Improves UX vs. forcing user to click

5. Document architecture decisions immediately
   - CLAUDE.md captures routing approach, styling, tech stack
   - Prevents future sessions from re-learning project structure
   - Focus on "why" and "where things go" not "how to use React"

6. TypeScript with strict mode catches issues early
   - Project already has strict: true
   - Leverage this for catching bugs in new code


================================================================================
NEXT STEPS (RECOMMENDATIONS)
================================================================================

- we are building minimalistic, no friction submission just to get working testflight submission
- all previous attempts have failed. we are building bare bones.
- to see where error is. I have submitted. using eas build -p ios --auto-submit
- now waiting

Fonts not the same.
on calendar screen th highlighted gold day the gold pill is not centered on day
there is no settings cog and settings modal
